# Consumer-Default-Using-GMM
Given a particular data-set, calculate the probability of loan default for individual customer using Gaussian Mixture Model and calculate the expected loss and gain by using those probabilities. Finding out the Factor importance and comparing our model with Support Vector Machine

The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) stands as a fundamental and versatile statistical technique with a widespread application in the domain of finance. In the realm of consumer loan management, GMMs serve as a powerful tool for estimating the probability of default for individual customers. These models group customers into clusters based on feature similarities, enabling the assessment of bankruptcy probabilities within each cluster.
